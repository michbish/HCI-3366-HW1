The current design problems are:

- Fire hazard interface to high and out of reach of handicapped and shorter people. If there is a problem with the elevator and the users need immediate assistance the fire hazard interface could be out of reach in a most crucial time.

- Floor :star: V doesnâ€™t indicate what the purpose of that floor means. It should have a Handicap symbol instead to illustrate that specific floor is for Handicapped people and or anyone loading or unloading from the building.

- The close door button seems to be two buttons. Removing unnecessary buttons will help with confusion.

- Removing the obvious issue with the missing buttons covered with a note which are the open door buttons have been ordered as the note states.
